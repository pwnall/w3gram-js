# WebSocket client specialized for reciving W3gram push notifications.
#
# A client uses the WebSocket URL given in the constructor. However, the W3gram
# protocol requires a routing HTTP request before each WebSocket connection.
# Therefore, once disconnected, this client cannot be reconnected.

  #   for the connection
  # @option options {Number} pingSlackMs the Ping timeout slack; this is added
